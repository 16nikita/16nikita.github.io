I am a data scientist in the Bruce Wang Lab at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Here, I specialize in single-cell RNA sequencing pipeline development and deployment, with the aim of understanding heterogeneity and disease progression in the human and mouse liver. I also serve as a collaborator for all labs within the UCSF Liver Center community. Though my research in the past two years has been in human health, I have amassed a wealth of transferrable technical skills. I have maintained a fascination with the natural world outside of us. I believe the mistreatment of Earth is the root cause for much of humanity's ailments; you cannot address public health without addressing the wellbeing of our planet.

I graduated summa cum laude from Cornell University in 2022 with a B.A. in Biological Sciences concentrating in Computational Biology and a minor in Climate Change. At Cornell, I worked in the Pawlowski Lab on a series of collaborative projects using computational approaches to illuminate the factors controlling meiotic recombination in maize and rice. The goal of these projects was uncovering recombination hotspots to enables these crops unlock the genetic diversity needed to withstand growing climate pressures.

Moving forward, I will integrate my interests in climate change, research, and bioinformatics to fight for environmental justice. My next steps include earning a PhD in Plant Sciences in efforts to follow this dream. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website.
