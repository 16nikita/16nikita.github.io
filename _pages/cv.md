## Research Experience  
---

**Junior Specialist**  
*Bruce Wang Lab, UCSF* â€” *May 2023â€“Present*  
- Lead data scientist on single-cell and physiological studies of liver development and disease progression in human and mouse models.  
  - **Project 1:** Designed and curated a panel of healthy human liver marker genes for the 10X Xenium Spatial Transcriptomics platform to improve spatial resolution of cell types.  
  - **Project 2:** Analyzed scRNA-seq data from porphyria mouse models (Tartis mutation), identifying disease-associated transcriptional programs in hepatocytes and other liver cell populations.  
  - **Project 3:** Integrated scRNA-seq datasets generated via 10X Genomics and Seq-Well platforms to enable unified analysis of liver cell states across technologies.  
  - **Project 4:** Used Monocle3 and NicheNet to model pseudotemporal trajectories and predict ligandâ€“receptor interactions driving communication between macrophages and diseased hepatocytes.  
  - **Project 5:** Analyzed physiological experimental data from mouse models subjected to hormonal and metabolic perturbations (estrous cycle, circadian rhythm, fasting), identifying time- and sex-dependent transcriptional responses.  
- Develop and maintain custom pipelines using Linux, R, and Python for data preprocessing, integration, and visualization.  
- Provide bioinformatics consulting to UCSF Liver Center labs, supporting diverse projects in single-cell RNA-seq, single-nuclei RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and ATAC-seq.


**Research Assistant**  
*Pawlowski Lab, Cornell University* â€” *Sept 2021â€“April 2023*  
- Collaborated with Dr. Wojtek Pawlowski and PhD student Ruth Epstein on multiple projects:  
  - **Project 1:** Tested chromatin openness in maize; developed in Linux and R (lead researcher).  
  - **Project 2:** Simulated effects of mutant recombination landscapes in maize breeding (*published in PNAS*); built with AlphaSimR in R.  
  - **Project 3:** Honors thesisâ€”used machine learning to assess InDel generation potential of recombination; developed in Linux, R, and Python (lead researcher).

**Summer Research Intern (REU)**  
*Boyce Thompson Institute (Pawlowski Lab)* â€” *Jun 2021â€“Aug 2021*  
- Evaluate CO hotspot proximity to haplotype blocks. Project development in R.
- Conducted wet-lab work using immuno-FiSH and super-resolution microscopy to study crossover protein localization on inverted chromosome arms.  
- Collaborated directly with Ruth Epstein on all projects.
