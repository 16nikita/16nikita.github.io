## Research Experience  
---

**Junior Specialist**  
*Bruce Wang Lab, UCSF* â€” *May 2023â€“Present*  
- Lead data scientist on single-cell and physiological studies of liver development and disease progression in human and mouse models.
- Developed and maintained custom pipelines using Linux, R, and Python for data preprocessing, integration, and visualization on the following:  
  - **Project 1:** Developed a curated panel of marker genes to enhance identification and spatial mapping of liver cell types in healthy human tissue, enabling more expansive and precise characterization of liver architecture and cellular organization. 
  - **Project 2:** Investigated liver pathology in porphyria mouse models by characterizing transcriptional changes in hepatocytes and other liver cell types, uncovering disease-specific gene expression programs and altered cellular states. 
  - **Project 3:** Identified cell-to-cell signaling pathways and reconstructed hepatocyte differentiation trajectories to understand disease progression. 
  - **Project 4:** Examined how physiological processes (e.g. circadian rhythm, fasting, and the estrous cycle) influence liver gene expression across time and sex to understand baseline norms and deviations.   
- Additionally collaborated with other UCSF Liver Center labs, providing bioinformatics expertise on a diverse range of topics, such as: single-cell RNA-sequencing, single-nuclei RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and ATAC-sequencing.


**Research Assistant**  
*Pawlowski Lab, Cornell University* â€” *Sept 2021â€“April 2023*  
- Collaborated with Dr. Wojtek Pawlowski and PhD student Ruth Epstein on multiple projects using Linux, R and Python:  
  - **Project 1:** [*Honors thesis;*](https://16nikita.github.io/publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2) Evaluated the overlap of indels with crossover sites to understand the mutation generation potential of recombination hotspots in the maize genome.
  - **Project 2:** [*Published in PNAS;*](https://16nikita.github.io/publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1) Simulated effects of mutant recombination landscapes in maize and rice breeding in efforts to increase global recombination rates and improve the efficiency of breeding programs   
  - **Project 3:** Lead researcher; tested the effectiveness of DNA sonication methods to assess chromatin openness in maize.

**Summer Research Intern (REU)**  
*Boyce Thompson Institute (Pawlowski Lab)* â€” *Jun 2021â€“Aug 2021*  
- Collaborated with Dr. Wojtek Pawlowski and PhD student Ruth Epstein:
  - Evaluate crossover hotspot proximity to haplotype blocks in maize. Project development in R.
  - Conducted wet-lab work using immuno-FiSH and super-resolution microscopy to study crossover protein localization on inverted chromosome arms.
