The purpose of this project was to evaluate the feasibility of capsaicin as an alternative, organic pesticide. With huge annual crop losses to pests and the toxicity of current pest control chemicals, it would be doubly beneficial to use a less toxic, but equally effective, compound. This paper evaluates whether capsaicin could be an organic alternative to conventional pesticides. There were two fronts studied to evaluate (1) capsaicinâ€™s mode of actions in insect targets and (2) to understand whether capsaicin production could be engineered in plants other than pepper to allow for innate defenses. This research identified key motifs conserved in capsaicin-metabolizing proteins, namely CYP6B6, found in common agricultural pests. In addition, the feasibility of developing spicy plants in the Solanaceae family was evaluated by looking at the conservation of key residues in capsaicin synthase homologs in crops closely related to pepper. Protein-ligand docking was used in both sections in order to identify binding residues and to identify putative active sites in relevant proteins.

**Tools:**
* Motif discovery: MEME Suite
* Protein-ligand docking: Chimera, p2Rank, MedusaDock, PyMOL
* Sequence analysis: MUSCLE
* Structural modeling and docking predictions were carried out to evaluate both detoxification potential in insects and synthetic feasibility in crop relatives.
