Presented development and validation of a spatial transcriptomics gene panel tailored for human liver tissue profiling using the 10X Xenium platform.

**Abstract:** Spatial transcriptomics is a relatively new technique that complements single-cell sequencing techniques, enabling the visualization and localization of gene expression data in situ at a single cell resolution. The field has experienced an explosion in development, with a variety of diverse approaches emerging in recent years, including high plex in situ technologies such as Xenium In Situ (10x Genomics). Xenium is designed to provide subcellular spatial resolution using the highly specific and sensitive padlock probe rolling circle amplification technique, accommodating both fresh frozen (FF) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. 

We aim to utilize the Xenium platform to explore liver heterogeneity in healthy individuals and analyze tissue and cellular transcriptome changes under diseased conditions like Auto-Immune Hepatitis (AIH) and hepatoblastoma. This platform offers a fully-customizable gene panel, but challenges remain in crafting a panel composed of highly specific genes that are compatible with cell segmentation methods. To design a panel for healthy liver tissue, we used publicly-available single-cell human liver datasets and a literature review of single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) studies of the human liver to generate a comprehensive list of the major cell types in the liver and find unique markers for each cell type.
